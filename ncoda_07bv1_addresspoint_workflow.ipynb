    "# Address Point Inventory Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Functions to obtain and clean data required for the Address Point Inventory - which is a key component of the Housing Unit Allocation process. The address point inventory predicts the number of housing units in each structure in a building inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources and references:\n",
    "For an overview of the address point invenotry and housing unit allocation method see:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosenheim, N., Guidotti, R., Gardoni, P., & Peacock, W. G. (2021). Integration of detailed household and housing unit characteristic data with critical infrastructure for post-hazard resilience modeling. Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, 6(6), 385-401.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Inputs\n",
    "Program requires the following inputs:\n",
    "1. program obtains and cleans US Census Block Data\n",
    "2. program requires a geocoded building inventory\n",
    "    - Future version of ICD will provide tools for generating a building inventory file\n",
    "    - Current version will require users to have an IN-CORE account\n",
    "3. Housing Unit Inventory - for expected address point counts by block\n",
    "4. program will use the block data, expected counts, and building inventory to generate an address point inventory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Output Description\n",
    "The output of this workflow is a CSV file with the address point inventory and a codebook that describes the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output CSV is designed to be used in the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE) for the housing unit allocation model.\n",
