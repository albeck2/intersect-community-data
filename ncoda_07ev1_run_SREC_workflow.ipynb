    "# Student Record File Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Functions to obtain and clean data required for the Student Record File in Python using Census API and NCES files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow produces a Student Person Record (SREC) file that can be linked to the Person Record File. The file includes student level records with sex, grade level, race and ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on NCES data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this workflow is a CSV file with the student record file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output CSV is designed to be used in the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE) for the housing unit allocation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "IN-CORE is an open source python package that can be used to model the resilience of a community. To download IN-CORE, see:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Users can run the workflow by executing each block of code in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can modify the code to select one county or multiple counties."
