    "## Overview\n",
    "Functions to obtain and clean data required for the Student Record File in Python using Census API and NCES files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow produces a Student Person Record (SREC) file that can be linked to the Person Record File. The file includes student level records with sex, grade level, race and ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on NCES data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this workflow is a CSV file with the student record file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output CSV is designed to be used in the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE) for the housing unit allocation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "IN-CORE is an open source python package that can be used to model the resilience of a community. To download IN-CORE, see:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Users can run the workflow by executing each block of code in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can modify the code to select one county or multiple counties."

    "This look steps through each row (`iterrows`) in the dataframe. The loop creates a dictionary with the name and location of the data documentation file and the datafile. The second internal loop steps through the two files to download. The internal loop first checks to see if the file has already been downloaded. If the file has `not` been downloaded the program uses the `wget` function to download the data from the `url`. If the has been downloaded (`else`) the program outputs a comment that the file has already been downloaded. This loop helps manage the downloading of many complext files and the associated documentation. The structure of the loop reinforces the provenance of the data - which will help future project members understand the source of the school location and attendance data."
