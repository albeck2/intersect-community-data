## USA Structures

Description
This feature layer, utilizing Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) data, displays footprints for all structures (buildings) greater than 450 square feet in the United States and its territories. Per FEMA, "It provides cartographic context for urban density, patterns of use, visual reference, and navigation support."

Notes: 
This dataset does not meet the Map Accuracy Standards and has limited cartographic use at scales larger than 1:24,000. Also, "-99999" values are used when there is currently no data available.
Currently, occupancy type is available for the states/territories of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. Additional occupancy type information is being developed and will be added for other states and territories in the future.
