### Building Footprint Comparison
This map shows the results of a comparison between two large building footprint datasets: from Bing and OpenStreetMap. These results were generated using the open source libraries, VectorPipe and Tippecanoe. There are 125 million building footprints from Bing and 33 million in OpenStreetMap. This map helps show how they differ.
