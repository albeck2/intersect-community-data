National Address Database
The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its partners from all levels of government recognize the need for a National Address Database (NAD).  Accurate and up-to-date addresses are critical to transportation safety and are a vital part of Next Generation 9-1-1. They are also essential for a broad range of government services, including mail delivery, permitting, and school siting. To meet this need, USDOT partners with address programs from state, local, and tribal governments to compile their authoritative data into the NAD.

Release 12 of the NAD, containing 67.3 million records, is now available for download from the link at the top left of this page. 


National Address Database (NAD) Disclaimer
Before downloading, please read the disclaimer below:

The National Address Database (NAD) is, with few exceptions, aggregated from state data, which is in turn aggregated from local data. While it is considered to be authoritative and every reasonable effort is made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) makes no warranties, expressed or implied, concerning the accuracy, completeness or suitability of the data, and it should not be construed or used as a legal description.

In no event shall USDOT become liable to users of this data, or any other party, for any loss or damages, consequential or otherwise, including but not limited to time, money, or goodwill, arising from the use, operation or modification of the data.

In using this data, users further agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless USDOT for any and all liability of any nature arising out of or resulting from the lack of accuracy or correctness of the data, or the use of the data.

The states that partner with USDOT to provide data for the NAD do so willingly, with no obligation. Not every state that provides data to the NAD has complete coverage. As state address programs expand and mature, USDOT expects the coverage to expand as well.

Published data made available as a part of the NAD is provided as a public service to enhance open government, transparency, and accountability.  The NAD is a compilation of data provided by state, local, and tribal governments and is made available “as is.”  The NAD is a work of the federal government and as such is not subject to copyright protection in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 105.  It is available for re-use without limitation or restriction.
