    "> Purpose of School Location Data: \"The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program develops data resources and information to help data users investigate the social and\n",
    "spatial context of education. School point locations (latitude/longitude values) are a key component of the NCES data collection.\" (Geverdt, 2018a p. 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "School location data is collected for:\n",
    "* Public schools\n",
    "    - elementary\n",
    "    - public secondary\n",
    "    - location education agencies\n",
    "* Private schools\n",

    "This look steps through each row (`iterrows`) in the dataframe. The loop creates a dictionary with the name and location of the data documentation file and the datafile. The second internal loop steps through the two files to download. The internal loop first checks to see if the file has already been downloaded. If the file has `not` been downloaded the program uses the `wget` function to download the data from the `url`. If the has been downloaded (`else`) the program outputs a comment that the file has already been downloaded. This loop helps manage the downloading of many complext files and the associated documentation. The structure of the loop reinforces the provenance of the data - which will help future project members understand the source of the school location and attendance data."
