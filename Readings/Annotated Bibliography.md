# Problem Statement
Draft ideas: Refining social vulnerability indicators to be consistent and parsimonious with household and individual level characteristics may have a stronger link to mitigation and recovery planning.

Cumulative vulnerability exists when a household fits multiple vulnerability categories, for example an single parent household where the single parent is a woman age 70, with a disability, who doesn't speak English, doesn't own a car, and is responsible for 2 children under age 5

US Census Bureau (n.d.) "What Are Synthetic Data?" https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/factsheets/2021/what-are-synthetic-data/what-are-synthetic-data.pdf.

Synthetic data are:
1. "data that are completely simulated for testing purposes."
2. "combining data, often from multiple sources, to produce estimates for more granular populations than any one source can support."
3. "modeled statistical outputs released in a format that closely resembles the confidential data format."
4. "disaggregated to the individual- or business-record level, or aggregated into tabular format."

Examples:
1. U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates
2. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
3. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
4. LODES OnTheMap web application
5. LEHD’s PostSecondary Employment Outcomes
6. Census Frames Project https://www2.census.gov/about/partners/cac/sac/meetings/2021-03/presentation-frames-project.pdf

## Disaggregation matters

"If the mantra in real estate is “location, location, location,” the mantra for public data users is—or should be: “disaggregation, disaggregation, disaggregation.”

## Household level Social Vulnerability intersect with Flood Models

Preisser, M., Passalacqua, P., Bixler, R. P., & Hofmann, J. (2022). Intersecting near-real time fluvial and pluvial inundation estimates with sociodemographic vulnerability to quantify a household flood impact index. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 26(15), 3941-3964. https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3941-2022 
“While aggregated results can draw attention to broad regions of risk, household level data are required to properly classify who will be impacted. This
is not the first study to incorporate tax parcel data to at­tempt to estimate a hazard at the household level (Nelson et al., 2015; Fahy et al., 2019); however, previous studies have relied on 100-year floodplain data that lack pluvial es­timates.” (Preisser et al., 2022, p. 3957)

“If you have a big enough data set, it starts to leak information in unexpected ways.” Even more so when data from different sources are connected, he said: “When you combine one data set with another to make a bigger data set, nonobvious linkages can arise.” Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University
This is the case for my work intersecting community data. When i combine decennial census, ACS, LODES, NCES, nontrivial linkages arise.

## Relationship between households and governing regimes

Ribot, Jesse. "Cause and response: vulnerability and climate in the Anthropocene." Journal of Peasant Studies 41.5 (2014): 667-705.

Focus on the concepts of entitlements and relationships between households and influence over governing agents...
To operationalize Ribot (2014)  concept a synthetic population could be built that connects the individual to a household location, a work location, schools, city, county, state and federal governments.
For example, one could see that a household lives and works in the same city, county, and possibly the same congressional district.

A hypothesis to explore would be if households that live, work and attend school in the same governing regimes have a greater sense of control or influence.
Do wealthier racial majority households have fewer governing regimes to contend with because their activity space more closely aligns with jurisdictional boundaries.

Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, 6(6), 385–401. https://doi.org/10.1080/23789689.2019.1681821 - Proposed a method to translate aggregated areal unit data into disaggregated housing unit that encompasses household specific characteristics (i.e., tenure, household size, and vacancy type). The integration of four inventories such as housing unit, address point, building, and critical infrastructure inventories can help in identifying community areas that are more vulnerable to the impacts of natural hazards.

Integration of physical infrastructure and socio-economic systems for comprehensive uncertainty propagation in community resilience models. The 13th International Conference on Structural Safety and Reliability, Shanghai, P.R. China. - The population dislocation algorithm was integrated with the housing unit characteristics (i.e., tenure status, race or ethnicity, and household income) to identify the differential impacts of hazards across population subgroups, therefore, potential inequities. “The population dislocation algorithm predicts whether a household will dislocate immediately following the hazard event.”

Symp. on Reliability Engineering and Risk Management, Singapore. https://doi.org/10.3850/978-981-18-5184-1_MS-18-034-cd - A comprehensive post-hazard functionality model was developed by integrating the physical functionality of buildings and utility networks with household characteristics (i.e., race or ethnicity, sex, age, income). The model provides a combined measurement of the physical and socio-economic functionality of buildings in a community after a hazard event.

In analyzing the socio-economic impact, two models were used: computable general equilibrium model and population dislocation model at the household level (i.e., household structure, tenure status).

Methodology to incorporate seismic damage and debris to evaluate strategies to reduce life safety risk for multi-hazard earthquake and tsunami. Natural Hazards. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-023-05937-8 - One of the components in the proposed framework was “social environment” that includes populations layers of residents, employees, and tourists. This layer determines the population at risk for earthquake and tsunami. The resident population was identified through the housing unit allocation model (i.e., number of people in housing units, and land use types including residential, commercial, vacant, and seasonal rental).

International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, 59, 102259. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102259 - Housing unit allocation model was used to monitor how the housing recovery affects the people residing in each building. This “allows the prediction of delays based on the household income allocated to each housing unit based on race, ethnicity, and household size at the census block level as well as census tract level income distributions.”

Population dislocation and housing unit allocation model were used to determine population dislocation probabilities for each building in terms of loss in property value and types of buildings as well as for household characteristics (i.e., Black, Hispanic).

Symp. on Reliability Engineering and Risk Management, Singapore. https://doi.org/10.3850/978-981-18-5184-1_MS-18-096-cd - One of the approaches for infrastructure retrofit prioritization was the social impact criticality-based approach in which retrofit prioritization decisions rely on the impacts of household dislocation probability in an infrastructure outage situation. Housing unit allocation model was used here to assign household characteristics (i.e., Black, Hispanic) to each structure.

Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure, 7(5), 531–551. https://doi.org/10.1080/23789689.2021.1966164 - Research Question: “how resilient are parcels within a community given that they rely on these same infrastructure systems and how can this be used to evaluate resilience at both the parcel- and community-level”? By integrating spatial Bayesian network with the housing unit allocation model, it is possible to determine the differential impacts of hazards across population subgroups within a community. Parcel level resilience can be matched with parcel level demographic and socio-economic information to ensure equitable community resilience planning.

Natural Hazards Review, 22(3), 04021013. https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000459 - Presented a framework that integrates hazard model uncertainties, fragility curves, and housing unit inventory model. Housing unit inventory (i.e., race, ethnicity, income, tenure status) was linked to the building inventory and household evacuation model was developed to determine probabilistic estimates of the households that are less likely to respond to evacuation calls.
