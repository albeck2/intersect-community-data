Synthetic data are:
1. "data that are completely simulated for testing purposes."
2. "combining data, often from multiple sources, to produce estimates for more granular populations than any one source can support."
3. "modeled statistical outputs released in a format that closely resembles the confidential data format."
4. "disaggregated to the individual- or business-record level, or aggregated into tabular format."

Examples:
1. U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates
2. Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)
3. LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)
4. LODES OnTheMap web application
5. LEHD’s PostSecondary Employment Outcomes
6. Census Frames Project https://www2.census.gov/about/partners/cac/sac/meetings/2021-03/presentation-frames-project.pdf
7. National Emergency Number Association (NENA) Structure Address Point GIS Data for 9-1-1
